# Changelog

## Unreleased

- **Add steering support** — a steer sent while a tool was running used to be stashed and replayed as a continuation query after Claude's whole turn finished - so basically the same as a followup. The prompt is now a long-lived streaming-input generator, and a steer is written to CC's stdin (`priority: "next"`) *before* the tool result is released to the MCP handler. Both travel the same stdin FIFO, so CC drains the steer at that tool boundary and acts on it in the same turn. Image steers keep their images. Removes `deferredUserMessages` and the continuation-replay path.
- **Fix: images dropped when not on the final user message (issue #34)** — `extractUserPromptBlocks` only scanned the last message, so an image followed by a trailing text preview lost the image. Now scans the full trailing run of user messages and hoists all image blocks.
- **Fix: crash on data-less image blocks** — the debug log read `block.data.length` before the guard that skips data-less images, so one malformed block threw out of the fresh-query path on every retry.
- **Tests: harness hygiene** — the unit suite redirects `CLAUDE_BRIDGE_DEBUG_PATH` via a preloaded `tests/lib/setup.mjs` instead of per-file boilerplate, so no test can write to the real bridge log; the integration harness now probes `~/.claude` for writability at startup and fails fast instead of surfacing a confusing `No conversation found with session ID` on the next resume. The probe filename is per-pid — the shared name raced under the concurrent int runner, killing a random test file at import with that same misleading error.
- **Fix: nested tool schemas flattened (issue #44)** — converting pi schemas to Zod for `createSdkMcpServer` collapsed nested objects to open records and dropped `anyOf`/`const`, so Claude saw only the top level of tools like `edit` and `subagent`. The MCP server is now built directly and answers `tools/list` with pi's JSON Schema verbatim.
- **Fix: tool results paired by call order** — MCP handlers took their `toolCallId` from a positional cursor, so a call arriving out of order or not at all silently paired a result with the wrong tool call. Now uses Claude's `_meta["claudecode/toolUseId"]` and fails loudly if it is absent; also stops leaking `toolCallId` into the MCP result.
- **Fix: images dropped from rebuilt sessions** — tool results carrying an image were flattened to text, and cc-session-io below 0.3.2 discarded image blocks from user messages, so images vanished whenever the bridge rewrote pi's history into a Claude Code session. Tool results now keep image blocks; requires cc-session-io `^0.3.2`.
- **Fix: `--system-prompt` and `--append-system-prompt` silently ignored** — the bridge sends Claude Code's preset system prompt and only forwarded AGENTS.md and skills, so the user's own prompt text never reached the model. Both flags are now appended, after the bridge's own additions and regardless of the `appendSystemPrompt` setting, which only governs context the bridge injects itself.
- **Fix: thinking blocks kept a dead provider check** — `msg.api === "anthropic"` could never match, since `"anthropic"` is a provider id and pi's api id is `"anthropic-messages"`. Only Claude Code's own thinking is replayed now, which is what already happened; the unit test asserting otherwise was passing a value pi never emits.
- **Add: one-time plan notice** — `provider.plan` defaults to `"pro"`, so Max subscribers silently lose Opus at 1M context if they don't set plan in settings. Now prints a one-time notice if plan isn't set.
- **Fix: API errors reported as a successful turn (issue #43)** — CC flags failures with `is_error` on a result whose subtype is still `"success"`, so the bridge duplicated the error text and finalized as a normal stop. Failed results now end the turn with `stopReason: "error"`, and the compact-summary path no longer accepts an errored result as a summary.
- **Fix: rebuilt sessions recorded the bare model id (issue #42)** — session rebuilds wrote pi's model id into the Claude Code transcript instead of the resolved CLI id, so records for a 1M model were missing the `[1m]` suffix. Metadata only: the served model and context window come from `--model`, which was already correct.


## 0.6.3 — 2026-07-26

- **Add: claude-opus-5 model** — Claude Opus 5 is selectable via `/model` and the `opus` shortcut now points to it.
- **Bump: pi >=0.82.1** — required for the `claude-opus-5` model catalog entry.
- **Internal: remove obsolete QueryContext stack** — remove the unused push/pop/depth infrastructure superseded by `activeQueryContexts`.

## 0.6.2 — 2026-07-06

- **Fix: Sonnet 5 and Fable 5 with 1M context** — bare model IDs (`claude-sonnet-5`, `claude-fable-5`) are 200K context. Must pass `[1m]` suffix for both, similar to Opus 4.8.
- **Fix: xhigh thinking level hidden for Sonnet 5 and Sonnet 4.6 (issue #32)** — pi-ai ships no `thinkingLevelMap` for these models, and pi's `getSupportedThinkingLevels` requires an explicit mapping to show `xhigh` in the picker. This is a workaround for https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6371

## 0.6.1 — 2026-07-01

- **Add: claude-fable-5 and claude-sonnet-5 models** — Anthropic's Claude Fable 5 (released 2026-06-09) and Sonnet 5 (released 2026-06-30) are now selectable via `/model`. Both force adaptive thinking. The `fable` and `sonnet` shortcuts resolve to these new models.
- **Bump: pi-ai >=0.80.3** — required for claude-fable-5 and claude-sonnet-5 model catalog entries.

## 0.6.0 — 2026-06-29

- **Fix: `/compact` hang (issue #18)** — the bridge now owns compaction for claude-bridge models, running split-turn summaries as isolated Claude Code subprocesses instead of routing them through the live provider stream. File ops (`<read-files>`/`<modified-files>`) carry forward across compactions. If compaction fails it is cancelled with a notification rather than falling back to the buggy native path.
- **Fix: subagent routing (issue #19)** — provider calls from subagents while a parent query is active now start a nested query instead of being mistaken for empty tool-result delivery.
- **Fix: session preservation across `/compact` and tree nav (issue #25)** — the main Claude Code session is no longer clobbered by shorter synthetic contexts (compact summaries) or stale post-rewrite history.
- **Add: plan-aware 1M context (issue #24)** — new `provider.plan` (default `"pro"`) and `provider.longContextExtraUsage` config. See README for which models get 1M on which plan.
- **Add: reasoning token tracking** — Claude Code `reasoning_tokens`/`thinking_tokens` are preserved on pi usage objects and in debug logs.
- **Bump: pi 0.80 APIs** — compat catalog import, `CONFIG_DIR_NAME`, compaction metadata. Claude Agent SDK 0.2.x, TypeBox 1.3, tsx 4.22.

## 0.5.0 — 2026-06-05

- **Add: claude-opus-4-8 model** — migrated pi imports/dev peers from deprecated `@mariozechner/*` packages to `@earendil-works/*` 0.78.x so the official pi-ai registry supplies Opus 4.8. The `opus` shortcut now resolves to 4.8; 4.7/4.6 remain available for explicit pinning.
- **Docs: Agent SDK quota warning** — note Anthropic's announced June 15, 2026 Agent SDK billing/quota change.
- **Tests: isolate AskClaude config** — AskClaude integration tests now use project-local test config so they are unaffected by a user's global `askClaude.enabled` setting.
- **Tests: harden shell integration tests** — use explicit alternate provider/model settings and pre-increment counters under `set -e`.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-05-04

- **Fix: Opus 4.7 + xhigh sent wrong effort to SDK** — pi-ai 0.72 ships per-model `thinkingLevelMap` overrides (e.g. `claude-opus-4-7` declares `xhigh→xhigh`, not `xhigh→max`), but our hardcoded `REASONING_TO_EFFORT` table ignored them. Effort lookup now consults `model.thinkingLevelMap` first, falls back to the table for older pi-ai or unmapped levels. Forwarded `thinkingLevelMap` through `buildModels` projection.
- **Fix: zero out model cost in `buildModels`** — per-token pricing in the footer was wrong because models inherited pi-ai's non-zero cost fields, which pi then multiplied by the huge token counts from the SDK. Now explicitly zeroed so pi's footer shows no cost.
- **Use `tools: []` instead of `disallowedTools` blocklist** — switch from blocking specific tools to explicitly passing an empty tools list, preventing any new default tools from silently leaking into bridge sessions.
- **Disable CC-side autocompact (`DISABLE_AUTO_COMPACT=1`)** — pi already owns context management and propagates its own `/compact` to CC. Letting CC autocompact too double-flushed the prompt cache and raced pi's threshold; manual `/compact` in CC is unaffected.
- **Fix: pi `/compact` no longer triggers CC autocompact-thrashing (issue #8)** — pi's compaction shrinks its messages array, but `syncSharedSession`'s REUSE check (`slice(cursor)`) silently returned `[]`, so the bridge kept `--resume`ing the pre-compact CC session JSONL. Over long sessions CC's own autocompact then refilled within 3 turns and tripped its anti-thrashing guard. Now subscribes to pi's `session_compact` event and forces the next sync down the REBUILD path so CC sees the post-compact history. Also subscribes to `session_tree` (branch nav has the same shape).
- **Refactor: split `needsRebuild` into `needsRebuild` + `forceRotate`** — only the abort case needs UUID rotation (to dodge late writes from the dying CC subprocess). Compact/tree now rebuild in place, preserving the sessionId and not leaking orphan JSONL files into `~/.claude/projects/`.
- **Block user-installed MCP servers from leaking into bridge sessions** — pass `--strict-mcp-config` unconditionally and set `ENABLE_CLAUDEAI_MCP_SERVERS=0` in the spawned CC env, suppressing both filesystem (`~/.claude.json`, `.mcp.json`) and claude.ai cloud MCP servers. Override with `provider.strictMcpConfig: false`.
- **Consolidate config** — SDK plumbing (`appendSystemPrompt`, `settingSources`, `strictMcpConfig`) moved from `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` (`claudeAgentSdkProvider` block) to a `provider` block in `~/.pi/agent/claude-bridge.json`. Old location no longer read. Drop deprecated, unsafe `maxHistoryMessages`.
- **Bump deps** — `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` → ^0.2.126; migrate to TypeBox 1.x (new import paths per pi-mono 0.69); pi devDeps → ^0.72.1. Extract `registerTool` schemas to const with explicit `<typeof params>` generic to avoid TS2589 deep-instantiation under TypeBox 1.x.
- **Internal: move sources into `src/`** — `index.ts` and the extracted modules now live under `src/`; screenshots under `assets/`. `pi.extensions` and published `files` updated accordingly.

## 0.3.1 — 2026-04-18

- **Fix: empty thinking blocks on Opus 4.7** — Opus 4.7 silently changed default `thinking.display` from `"summarized"` to `"omitted"`, so streams emitted `thinking_start` + `signature_delta` with zero `thinking_delta` events, leaving `ThinkingBlock.thinking == ""`. Now pass `--thinking-display=summarized` via `extraArgs` whenever `effort` is set (both provider and AskClaude paths). Bump `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` to ^0.2.111 (required for Opus 4.7 + `--thinking-display` CLI flag). See [anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python#830](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python/pull/830).
- **Fix: `cachePct` debug metric misleading** — denominator was `input + cacheRead`, so once a conversation warmed up (tiny `input`, huge `cacheRead`) every turn rounded to 100% — even turns that rebuilt the cache from scratch. Now `cacheRead / (input + cacheRead + cacheWrite)`, so cache-rebuild turns show a low percentage.
- **Internal: extract pure modules from `index.ts`** — split `models`, `skills`, `session-verify`, `extract-tool-results`, and `query-state` into their own TS files with real unit tests (no more `.js`+`.d.ts` mirror drift). Add `typecheck` script, `typescript` + `tsx` devDeps; test scripts run via `--import tsx`.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-04-17

- **Add: claude-opus-4-7 model** — Added `claude-opus-4-7` as a selectable model. The `opus` shortcut now resolves to 4.7 by default; 4.6 remains available for explicit pinning. Bumped `@mariozechner/pi-ai` to ^0.67.6 to include official model definitions (removed fallback).
- **Refactor: QueryContext class replaces module-level state** — 12 mutable `let` variables + manual `SavedQueryState` push/pop replaced with a `QueryContext` class and context stack. Adding new per-query state is now 1 property instead of 6 edit sites. Fixes `deferredUserMessages` not being isolated across reentrant queries (subagent could consume parent's deferred steers). MCP handlers now close over captured context, abort handler captures context at the correct point after push.
- **Fix: MODELS baseUrl leak** — the MODELS array exported to pi's provider registration now projects only the fields pi needs (id/name/reasoning/input/cost/contextWindow/maxTokens), stripping pi-ai's `baseUrl`/`api`/`provider`/`headers` so they can't shadow the values `registerProvider` supplies.
- **Internal: `repairToolPairing` moved to cc-session-io 0.3.0**; convert logic extracted to `convert.js` with `convert.d.ts` types; various dead-code / type-safety cleanup.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-04-15

- **Fix: stale cursor after tool-using first turn (issue #4)** — after the first turn used tools, the session cursor pointed at the wrong message, causing Claude to re-process stale context. Now correctly advances past all tool_result blocks.
- **Fix: session resume on symlinked paths / CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR** — cc-session-io now resolves symlinks (realpathSync + NFC) and honors `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, matching how Claude Code resolves session paths. Fixes "No conversation found" on macOS symlinked dirs. Bump cc-session-io → 0.2.0.
- **Verify-after-write for session files** — warns with diagnostic context if the written session file doesn't round-trip correctly, instead of letting Claude silently resume a corrupt session.
- **Session rebuild preserves sessionId** — provider switches no longer churn UUIDs.
- **CC CLI debug capture** — `CLAUDE_BRIDGE_DEBUG=1` now also writes Claude Code's own debug stream to `~/.pi/agent/cc-cli-logs/`, one file per query.
- **Fix: debug() logged Error objects as `{}`** — now formats with message and stack.
- **Repair orphan tool_use/tool_result pairs before import** — prevents potential API 400s when history starts mid-turn after a provider switch.

## 0.1.6 — 2026-04-10

- **Fix: steer messages during tool execution now reach Claude** — when a user sends a steer while a tool is executing, pi injects it into context alongside the tool result. The bridge previously only processed tool results in this path, silently dropping the steer. Now detected and replayed as a continuation query after the current query completes.
- **Fix: "No conversation found with session ID" in dirs with dots/underscores/spaces** — bump `cc-session-io` to 0.1.2; `projectPathToHash` now matches the CLI's sanitization (`/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g` → `-`) instead of only replacing slashes
- **Fix: steer/followUp during tool execution no longer hangs** — `extractAllToolResults` now walks past injected user messages instead of stopping at them
- **ID-based tool result matching** — tool results are matched to MCP handlers by `toolCallId` instead of FIFO position; eliminates silent wrong-result delivery if order diverges
- Add integration tests for tool execution scenarios (normal, followUp, steer, parallel+steer, abort) with auto-restart on failure
- Add `defaultIsolated` config option for AskClaude
- Remove skill path aliasing (`.pi/` → `.claude/` round-trip); pass through real paths instead
- Rewrite skills block to reference MCP-bridged read tool (`mcp__custom-tools__read`)
- **Fix: AskClaude action summary showed raw SDK tool names** — normalize `mcp__custom-tools__*` and SDK names at creation; hide redundant `BashOutput` and recursive `AskClaude`; collapse only consecutive same-tool calls
